For the FRED DBs and macro economic trends. I need to temper my expectations, but here are some ideas on ways to find
significant things:

- Try breaking the search into 2-3 subsections, one for each of downtrend, uptrend, and stagnation in the market. Something may correlate to one of these without correlating to all of them.

- Look at both (1d, 2d, 3d, 7d, etc) % change and also % drawdown from ATH (and other drawdown periods)

- Check for changes in STDEV values, especially when transitioning between growth and contraction phases.

- So, we have things like STDEV, % change, CAGR, drawdown, sharpe/sortino/etc ratios, etc that we can look at. And different periods we can use for each.

- Look at the technical indicators like moving average, rsi, bollinger bands, etc
