## What is Priority 7?

Priority 7 is the next batch of work for Finbot, focusing on **maximizing external impact** while **demonstrating continued technical growth**. With Priorities 0-6 substantially complete (production-ready state), Priority 7 shifts focus to:

1. **Completion** - Finish Priority 5 to 100%
2. **Visibility** - Publish blog posts, videos, and research materials
3. **Applications** - Prepare portfolio pieces for medical school
4. **Advanced Features** - Add sophisticated technical capabilities
5. **Community** - Enable future collaboration and contribution

- Multi-objective optimization framework (Pareto frontier, partial)
- Hypothesis testing module (t-tests, bootstrap CI)
- Deferred unit tests (bond_ladder, batch, etc.)

**Outcome:** Statistical rigor tools + 15+ new tests

---

### Phase 6: Documentation & Wrap-Up (Week 11)
**Goal:** Update all documentation

- Getting Started video tutorial (10 min)
- FAQ document (20+ Q&A pairs)
- Contributing Guide video (5 min)
- Roadmap updates
- Priority 7 completion summary

**Outcome:** Comprehensive docs + videos

---

## Key Deliverables

**Publications (9 total):**
- 5 external publications (3 blog posts, 1 video, 1 poster)
- 4 application materials (reflection, portfolio, lessons, impact)

**Code Features (7 total):**
- 3 advanced features (migration, visualization, regime strategy)
- 1 optimization framework (partial)
- 1 hypothesis testing module
- 15+ new unit tests
- Coverage increase to 60%+

**Documentation (6 total):**
- 3 guides (Nautilus migration, FAQ, lessons learned)

## Decision Gates

**Gate 1 (End of Week 2):** Proceed to Phase 2 or focus on applications?
- **Criteria:** Priority 5 at 100%, coverage ≥60%, tests passing

**Gate 2 (End of Week 5):** Prioritize applications or continue features?
- **Criteria:** Med school deadline proximity, 3+ publications complete

**Gate 3 (End of Week 9):** Extend Phase 5 or wrap up?
- **Criteria:** Multi-objective optimization progress, time budget

---

## Deferred to Priority 8

**High-value items blocked or too large:**
- Options overlay strategies (2-3 weeks, requires options data)
- Real-time data feeds (1-2 weeks, cost unclear)
- Multi-objective optimization completion (1 week remaining)
- Some deferred unit tests (require FRED data or complex mocks)

---

## Documents Created

1. **Implementation Plan (Full):** `docs/planning/priority-7-implementation-plan.md`
   - 27 items with detailed specifications
   - 6 phases with dependencies and risks
   - Timeline, milestones, acceptance criteria
   - Rollout/rollback strategy
   - 90+ pages of detailed planning

2. **Quick Reference:** `docs/planning/priority-7-quick-reference.md`
   - At-a-glance summary
   - Priority matrix (by value/effort)
   - Quick commands
   - When to use each phase

3. **Roadmap Update:** `docs/planning/roadmap.md`
   - Priority 7 section added
   - Status tracking for all 27 items
   - Links to implementation plan

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Start Immediately
Begin Phase 1 (Completion Sprint) to get Priority 5 to 100%

### Option 2: Review & Adjust
Review the implementation plan and adjust:
- Timeline (11 weeks too long/short?)
- Priorities (which items most important?)
- Scope (add/remove items?)

### Option 3: Wait for Medical School Timeline
If application deadlines unclear, wait and revisit when timeline known

---

## Questions for Consideration

1. **Medical School Timeline:** When are applications due? Should Phase 3 be accelerated?

2. **External Publications:** Which platforms interest you? (Medium, dev.to, personal blog, YouTube)

3. **Advanced Features:** Which features most exciting? (Visualization, optimization, regime strategies)

4. **Scope:** Does 27 items feel right, or should we add/remove?

5. **Timeline:** Is 11 weeks (10-15 hours/week) realistic?

6. **Deferred Items:** Should any deferred items (P7.18, P7.19) be reconsidered?

---

## How to Use Priority 7

**Daily:** Check current phase and active tasks in quick reference

**Weekly:** Review milestone progress and adjust timeline if needed

**At Gates:** Use decision gates (Weeks 2, 5, 9) to reassess priorities

**When Complete:** Create Priority 7 completion summary, update roadmap

---

**Implementation Plan:** `docs/planning/priority-7-implementation-plan.md` (90+ pages)
**Quick Reference:** `docs/planning/priority-7-quick-reference.md` (5 pages)
**Roadmap:** `docs/planning/roadmap.md` (updated with P7 section)

**Ready to begin when you are!**
