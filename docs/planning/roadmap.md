# Finbot Roadmap

**Created:** 2026-02-10
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Priority 0-5 baseline complete/progressing; Priority 6 adapter-first backtesting/live-readiness current cycle complete with post-E6 follow-up phase 2 complete (items 69-72); workspace test-suite stability recovered after sync-conflict cleanup; v8.0 planning cycle opened for Priority 5 closeout and type-hardening

Improvements, fixes, and enhancements identified from comprehensive project evaluations. Organized by priority tier. Previous items (Priority 0-4) have been implemented. New Priority 5 items focus on making the project suitable for Ontario medical school admissions (OMSAS/CanMEDS frameworks).

See Completed Items table below and git history for details on implemented features.

**Active Next-Batch Plan:** `docs/planning/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_8.0_PRIORITY5_CLOSEOUT_AND_TYPE_HARDENING.md`

---

## Priority 0: Bugs and Architectural Hazards ✓

All 6 items complete. Fixed logger duplication, import-time side effects, dangerous error handling, dual config system, ruff version mismatch, and added Dependabot.

## Priority 1: Critical Gaps ✓

All 3 items complete. Expanded test coverage (18 → 262 tests, 34.57% coverage), created 5 example notebooks with findings, and produced 3 research summaries.

**Remaining (Deferred — Not Blocking):**
- [ ] Add tests for `bond_ladder_simulator` end-to-end (requires yield data from FRED)
- [x] Add tests for `backtest_batch`: parallel execution, result aggregation
- [x] Add tests for `rebalance_optimizer`
- [x] Add tests for `approximate_overnight_libor`
- [ ] Add tests for data collection utilities: `get_history`, `get_fred_data` (requires mock API responses)
- [ ] Populate `tests/integration/` with at least one end-to-end pipeline test (requires data files)
- [x] Increase coverage target from 50% to 60% as more tests are added
- [ ] Consider publishing research findings as a blog post or short paper for external visibility

## Priority 2: High-Impact Improvements ✓

All 6 items complete. Added CLI interface (4 commands), fixed code smells, refactored fund simulations to data-driven config, improved git history (CHANGELOG.md), completed incomplete components, added Makefile.

**Remaining (Deferred — Not Blocking):**
- [ ] Apply data-driven config pattern to `sim_specific_bond_indexes.py` (only 3 functions, not worth refactoring)
- [ ] Adopt conventional commit format going forward

## Priority 3: Moderate Improvements ✓

All 7 items complete. Improved documentation (160 module docstrings, MkDocs site, ADRs), strengthened type safety (146 → 0 mypy errors), added performance benchmarks, improved CI/CD pipeline, improved pre-commit hooks, modernized pyproject.toml metadata, consolidated package layout.

**Remaining (Deferred — Not Blocking):**
- [ ] Enable stricter mypy settings (`disallow_untyped_defs`, etc.)
- [ ] Add `py.typed` marker file for PEP 561 compliance
- [ ] Pin CI action versions to SHA hashes
- [ ] Add scheduled CI for daily update pipeline (requires API keys in CI)
- [ ] Add notebook-specific lint workflow (e.g., nbQA) to complement source-only Ruff baseline

## Priority 4: Polish and Extensibility ✓

All 6 items complete. Added containerization, Streamlit web dashboard (6 pages), health economics extension (QALY simulator, CEA, treatment optimizer), additional strategies (DualMomentum, RiskParity, multi-asset Monte Carlo, inflation-adjusted returns), migrated from Poetry to uv, added data quality/observability.

**Remaining (Deferred — Not Blocking):**
- [ ] Add options overlay strategy (covered calls, protective puts) — requires options pricing model, Greeks calculations, and options chain data
- [ ] Investigate epidemiological backtesting — not feasible with Backtrader (finance-specific); would need purpose-built SIR/SEIR simulator
