# Trivy Ignore File
# This file allows you to ignore specific CVEs from security scans
# Copy to .trivyignore and customize as needed
#
# Format: One CVE ID per line, with optional comments
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Example: Ignore a false positive
# CVE-2024-12345

# Example: Ignore while waiting for upstream fix
# CVE-2024-67890
# Rationale: Waiting for Python base image update, low exploitability
# Tracked in: https://github.com/docker-library/python/issues/XXXX

# Example: Ignore low-severity issue in build-only dependency
# CVE-2024-11111
# Rationale: Only affects build stage, not runtime image

# Guidelines for adding ignores:
# 1. Always include a rationale comment
# 2. Link to upstream tracking issue if available
# 3. Include severity level and affected package
# 4. Set reminder to review (e.g., "Review by: 2026-03-01")
# 5. Remove when fixed version is available
