Staging Configuration

This module extends the base configuration and applies settings specifically
for the staging environment. The staging environment is a pre-production
environment used for final testing before deployment to production. It should
mirror the production settings as closely as possible while allowing for safe
testing and validation.

The configurations here typically include settings for a staging database,
appropriate logging levels, and any other environment-specific parameters.
